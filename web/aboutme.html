  <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;" id="H2">The Warrior Spirit</h3>
    <p>My favorite <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">hobby</span> <b> <i> passion</i></b>
    is improving myself training in self-defense.  I've been training in it in almost 8.5 years!
    I've learned so much about life, principles, and the way things work through the principles 
    of combative technique and practice.  It has helped me become a better communicator, a better
    husband, and overall a more fulfilled person.</p>
    <p>I think there is a value and personal refinement
    that comes to one who learns to achieve and master a skillset. Not only do they <b>improve</b>
    in that thing they are studying but also have the ability to relate the principles they learn
    to other facets in their life.  As they become better, they begin to see the world in a much
    clearer lense.  I feel that, because we're not perfect, we come to this earth with a muddyed, 
    imperfect view of how things are.  Fortunately we are blessed with opportunities to learn, 
    talents are givent to us so that we may become happy, but also refine ourselves.  This is what
    self-defense training has done for me!</p>
    <p>It is these things that I believe constitute the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">      The Warrior Spirit!</span>  From my observation, there is a difference between a warrior and a
    fighter.  A fighter is someone who develops skill but uses it for themselves or applies said
    skill <b>only</b> in the field in which the skill comes from.  The <i>true</i> warrior develops
    skill but uses it to enhance themselves and others around him.  They have the wisdom to see
    how the principles they learn apply to everyday life, thus enriching his own life and that 
    of others.  This is the key difference!</p>
